Generate Keys
-------------

To generate some AES keys for your !YubiKeys served via your YK-KSM,
you use the 'ykksm-gen-keys' tool.  The tool is useful for generating
large sets of test keys, for performance testing of the database and
web interface.  It can also be used to produce keying material that
are intended to used for programming real keys.

As you should never store encryption keys in plaintext, you typically
use the tool by piping it directly to GnuPG.  So the first step will
always be to create a OpenPGP key for your KSM host, see
link:Generate_KSM_Key.adoc[Generate KSM Key].  Below we will both sign
the data from and encrypt it to the same key id '8B88A11B'.  Here is
how you would generate 5 keys for test purposes:

[source, sh]
----
user@ksm:~$ ykksm-gen-keys --urandom 1 5 | gpg -a --encrypt -r 8B88A11B -s > keys.txt
user@ksm:~$ 
----

Note the flag --urandom will cause the tool to use /dev/urandom rather
than /dev/random, which speed things up but is considered by some to
have weaker security.

After this step you may want to import the keys into your KSM, see
link:Import_Keys_To_KSM.adoc[Import Keys To KSM].

In production, you may want to separate the key generation facility
into a separate machine with a separate OpenPGP key.

To display the test keys above, you can decrypt them using GnuPG:

[source, sh]
----
user@ksm:~$ gpg < keys.txt

You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "YK-KSM crater Import Key"

The format is documented in the
link:Key_Provisioning_format.adoc[Key Provisioning Format] page.

To generate many small files each containing just one key, you can use
a small wrapper like this:

[source, sh]
----
#!/bin/sh

set -e

start=$1
stop=$2
key=$3
urandom=$4

if test -z "$start" || test -z "$stop" || test -z "$key"; then
    echo "Usage: run-gen-keys START STOP KEY [--urandom]"
    echo ""
    echo "Example usage:"
    echo "  run-gen-keys 4711 11147 A1296239 --urandom"
    echo ""
    exit 0
fi

cur=$start
while test $cur -le $stop; do
    ykksm-gen-keys $urandom $cur | gpg -a --sign --encrypt -r $key > $cur.asc
    cur=`expr $cur + 1`
done
